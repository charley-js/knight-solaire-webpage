            <h2 id="about">Who is Solaire?</h2>
            <p>Knight Solaire of Astora is a charcter from the video game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls" target="_blank">Dark Souls</a>, he is a Warrior of Sunlight and is a fan favourite due to his jolly 
                attitude and famous line of dialogue 'Praise the Sun'. </p>
            <p>Solaire is on a quest to find 'his very own sun' , however it remains a mystery of what this actually is. He is an exceptionally powerful
            skilled knight, being trained in armed combat and sunlight miracles.
            </p>
            <p>There are two possible endings for Solaire, the majority of the time the Knight encounters a parasite known as a Sunlight Maggot which he 
                becomes obsessed with and ultimately goes insane due to its emition of a blinding light. The other ending , Solaire helps the protagonist 
                'Link the Fire', which can be implied he has then found his sun.
            </p>
            <p>Solaire does not directly appear in the other Souls games however his legacy is often referred too, with his armour, equipment, holy
                symbols and miracles referenced throughout.
            </p>
